# Activate Windows, Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD Watermarks

This repository contains recreated versions of the classic **Windows Activation watermark**, adapted for multiple operating systems.

The font used is **Segoe UI** (by Adobe Fonts). I do not condone or promote any malicious or unauthorized use of this font.  
The included SVG file contains two versions: one with **editable text fields** and another with **vectorized text**.  
If you have Segoe UI installed, you can edit the text freely to suit your needs.
